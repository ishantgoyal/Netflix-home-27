This application (a Netflix clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context) & Styled Components. I have built  the homepage. There are four different pages.

I used compound components (just a design pattern) to build my components, and there's over 20 to 30 movies examples as to how these are used. The styling is all handled via styled components. Using compound components made my actual dumb components really easy to test.
